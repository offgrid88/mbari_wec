The system is moored to the seafloor (typically in 80m of water) through a chain-catenary mooring connected to an anchor. As waves excite the system, a differential motion results between the buoy at the surface and the submerged heave cone. Resisting this motion results in energy being absorbed by the system, and this energy is converted to electrical form and stored in a battery bank on the buoy. The rest of this section provides details about the various components of the system Buoy, Heave Cone, and Mooring The buoy in the MBARI-WEC has a diameter of 2.6m, a waterplane area of 5 m^2, and a mass of 1400kg. This buoy houses the system battery and compute infrastructure, described below. The heave-cone component sits at about 30m depth and provides inertia and drag for the surface-buoy to pull against. The heave-cone has operable doors that can be opened to reduce the drag and inertial of this component in high sea-states. When the doors are open, the heave-cone has added-mass of about 10,000kg, in addition to it's own 600kg mass. When opened, the added-mass reduces to about 3,000kg, which reduces the inertial forcing and increses the natural frequency of the buoy -- heave-cone pair. A chain-catenary mooring and anchor connects to heave-cone to the ocean floor, keeping the buoy on-station. The system loading due to the mooring increases in higher winds and currents, but remains relatively low compared with the inertia forces the heave-cone creates. PTO System The power take-off device is located below the buoy and converts the differential motion and forces between the buoy and heave-cone from mechanical to eletrical energy. This device is an electro-hydraulic device in which a piston pumps oil through a hydraulic motor, causing an electrical motor/generator to spin and generate electrical energy. In parallel to the hydraulic ram, a pneumatic piston charged with an inert gas provides a sprint returning force for the system. The combination of the hydraulic and pneumatic pistons creates a spring-damper system for which the spring constant is set by the amount of gas in the systen, and the damping behavior is adjustable electronically by varying the torque on the hydraulic motor in response to conditions. The electrical-drive is a four-quadrant device in which the electric motor can operate as a generator in which energy flows into the battery, or as a motor in which energy is drawn from the battery. The winding-currents (and resulting torque) can be set arbitrarily, but by default the power take-off device acts as a generator, i.e. a damper resisting motion. Electrical System The electrical system of this buoy consists of a 325V battery system for energy storage, and a 24V system for powering ancillary instrumenation. The 325V battery is connected directly to the power take-off device motor drive electronics. In normal use, the motor-drive device is generating electrial energy at 325V which charges the battery system. In the case the battery is full (or dis-connected), the motor-drive system directs excess energy to an electrical load-dump device. This submerged heater plays a critcal role in maintaining a load on the power take-off device at all times. The electrical system also includes 300V-24V power supplies that provides 24 volts to the compute and instrumentation infrastructure in the system. In the case of low battery voltage due to an extended period of calm seas, the Compute and Control Systems The compute and control architecture of the system is such that critical functions are performed by micro-controllers throughout the system that implement default behaviors and stream sensor data continously. A Linux computer on the buoy performs data-logging and provides a command interface to the underlying micro-controllers. See figure. The system is designed such that the Linux computer is not necessary for safe behavior, if this computer re-boots or goes offline, the system will default to safe behaviors. Additionally, the microcontrollers will ignore damaging commands from the Linux computer. This architecture allows control algorithms running on the Linux computer to be started, stopped, and changed while the device is at sea through the cell-modem connection. The fundamental system behaviors are performed by a network of micro-controller based compute nodes, that communicate with the buoy Linux computer and with one-another through a Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. There are four of these controllers as follows: Battery Controller (BC_): This micro-controller monitors battery voltage, currents, state-of-charge, cell-balance, and environmental conditions inside the battery enclosure. This controller is largely a data-telemetery gathering item, but also includes an important low-voltage disconnect features which shuts down the 24V battery bus during periods of low-battery state-of-charge. During these periods the system continues to convert wave-energy and charge the batteries, but all sources of significant battery drain are disconnected which allows the battery to re-charge to a servicable level, even in calm conditions. Spring Controller (SC_): This micro-controller primarily monitors the piston position and a load-cell located between the buoy and power take-off component. Additionally, this controller responds to commands to change the gas pressure in each chamber of the pneumatic spring, a pumop to move gas from the lower pressure chamber to the higher pressure chamber, and a valve to do the opposite. Additionally, this controller can turn power on and off to the heave-cone. Power Converter (PC_): This controller implements the field-oriented control of the winding current in the generator. Heave-cone Controller (TC_): This The on-board linux computer is assessible from shore over a radio link (cell-modem, satellite, or line-of-site radio). This link enables enabling data-telemetry, real-time control, and software-updates to be applied to the Linux computer. Sensors and Measurements Load Cell: This is a load cell between the buoy and the power take-off device, and has a range of up to 20,000lbs. Piston Position: Inside the pneumatic spring there is a laser range-finder that contiously monitors the position of the power take-off piston. Pneumatic Pressures: The spring controller monitors the pressures of the two gas-chambers that make up the pneumatic spring. Buoy Inertial Measurement Unit: On-board the buoy there is a GPS disciplined six DOF attitude-heading and reference system. This unit monitors and resports the buoys attitude and GPS location. Heave Cone Inertial Measurement Unit: On-board the heave-cone there is an attitude-heading and reference system with a magnetometer and pressure sensor that reports the heave-cones orientation and depth.

Gazebo can use several different physics solvers to perform this solution, and the wave-energy buoy simulator in this project uses the DART physics engine. The physics engine solves the multi-body six degree-of-freedom problem for the motion of the connected buoy, power-take-off device, and heave cone, subject to initial conditions and forces that act on the various components as the simulation progresses. In the Gazebo simulator, these forces are provided by plugin code that applies forces to each body based on the state (position and velocity) of each component in the system at each timestep. The Gazebo simulator already includes several plugins that provide relevant forces such as buoyancy and hydrodynamic drag. Additionally, several additional plugins have been created for this simulator that provide the forcings on the system due to the electro-hydraulic power-take-off system, the pneumatic spring system, the tether connecting the PTO to the heave-cone, the mooring system that anchors the system, and the forcing on the buoy from the ocean surface waves. The sections below outline some details about how each of these forcings are modelled and computed. First however, the specific physical characteristics of the MBARI WEC are tabulated for reference. Physical Characteristics Each rigid body in the simulation has a \"Link Frame\" coordinate system in which all other characteristics of the body are defined in for computational purposes. This link-frame coordinate system is often selected to be at the location of a joint that connects the various bodies (which are also called links in the vernacular of Gazebo).

Using this quasi-static solution and discrete time steps, and also incorporating hysteresis, the process becomes: V_k = x_k A_{piston} + V_{dead} P_k = P_{k-1} \\left({V_{k-1} \\over V_k}\\right)^n ,\\,\\,\\, n = \\begin{cases} n_1 & \\text{if } v \\ge 0 \\\\ n_2 & \\text{otherwise.} \\end{cases} T_k = {P_k V_k \\over m R_{specific}} where k is the current time step.

Determining Parameter Values Linear regression was used to determine the polytropic indices for each chamber using empirical data from the physical system. Using pressure vs volume curves, n_1 is determined from increasing volume, and n_2 is determined from decreasing volume. The data is then preconditioned by taking the logarithm to linearize and perform regression to find the parameters.

The other parameters in the system are taken from CAD or empirically determined by comparing logged data from prescribed motion between simulation and the physical test bench.
