This project is complemented by developments in autonomous underwater vehicles, underwater vehicle docking, oceanographic instrumentation, autonomy, and science use. The MBARI-WEC is currently maintained by MBARI and operates for six-month periods near the MBARI facility in Moss Landing, California, and averages about 250 Watts of power capture, averaged through the weather cycles and seasons.

The architecture of the system is such that critical functions are performed by micro-controllers throughout the system that implement default behaviors and stream sensor data continuously. A Linux computer on the buoy performs data-logging and provides a command interface to the underlying micro-controllers. The system is designed such that the Linux computer is not necessary for safe behavior, if this computer re-boots or goes offline, the system will default to safe behaviors.

Using this interface, MBARI intends to make the system available to external researchers. By providing access to the hardware during the ongoing MBARI deployments of this system, the intention is to provide access to hardware that is often otherwise unavailable.

The system is moored to the seafloor (typically in 80m of water) through a chain-catenary mooring connected to an anchor. As waves excite the system, a differential motion results between the buoy at the surface and the submerged heave cone. Resisting this motion results in energy being absorbed by the system, and this energy is converted to electrical form and stored in a battery bank on the buoy. The rest of this section provides details about the various components of the system Buoy, Heave Cone, and Mooring The buoy in the MBARI-WEC has a diameter of 2.6m, a water-plane area of 5 m^2, and a mass of 1400kg. This buoy houses the system battery and compute infrastructure, described below. The heave-cone component sits at about 30m depth and provides inertia and drag for the surface-buoy to pull against. The heave-cone has operable doors that can be opened to reduce the drag and inertial of this component in high sea-states. When the doors are open, the heave-cone has added-mass of about 10,000kg, in addition to it's own 600kg mass. When opened, the added-mass reduces to about 3,000kg, which reduces the inertial forcing and increases the natural frequency of the buoy -- heave-cone pair. A chain-catenary mooring and anchor connects to heave-cone to the ocean floor, keeping the buoy on-station. The system loading due to the mooring increases in higher winds and currents, but remains relatively low compared with the inertia forces the heave-cone creates. PTO System The power take-off device is located below the buoy and converts the differential motion and forces between the buoy and heave-cone from mechanical to electrical energy. This device is an electro-hydraulic device in which a piston pumps oil through a hydraulic motor, causing an electrical motor/generator to spin and generate electrical energy. In parallel to the hydraulic ram, a pneumatic piston charged with an inert gas provides a sprint returning force for the system. The combination of the hydraulic and pneumatic pistons creates a spring-damper system for which the spring constant is set by the amount of gas in the system, and the damping behavior is adjustable electronically by varying the torque on the hydraulic motor in response to conditions. The electrical-drive is a four-quadrant device in which the electric motor can operate as a generator in which energy flows into the battery, or as a motor in which energy is drawn from the battery. The winding-currents (and resulting torque) can be set arbitrarily, but by default the power take-off device acts as a generator, i.e. a damper resisting motion. Electrical System The electrical system of this buoy consists of a 325V battery system for energy storage, and a 24V system for powering ancillary instrumentation. The 325V battery is connected directly to the power take-off device motor drive electronics. In normal use, the motor-drive device is generating electrical energy at 325V which charges the battery system. In the case the battery is full (or dis-connected), the motor-drive system directs excess energy to an electrical load-dump device. This submerged heater plays a critical role in maintaining a load on the power take-off device at all times. The electrical system also includes 300V-24V power supplies that provides 24 volts to the compute and instrumentation infrastructure in the system. In the case of low battery voltage due to an extended period of calm seas, the Compute and Control Systems The compute and control architecture of the system is such that critical functions are performed by micro-controllers throughout the system that implement default behaviors and stream sensor data continuously. A Linux computer on the buoy performs data-logging and provides a command interface to the underlying micro-controllers. See figure. The system is designed such that the Linux computer is not necessary for safe behavior, if this computer re-boots or goes offline, the system will default to safe behaviors. Additionally, the micro-controllers will ignore damaging commands from the Linux computer. This architecture allows control algorithms running on the Linux computer to be started, stopped, and changed while the device is at sea through the cell-modem connection. The fundamental system behaviors are performed by a network of micro-controller based compute nodes, that communicate with the buoy Linux computer and with one-another through a Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. There are four of these controllers as follows: Battery Controller (BC_): This micro-controller monitors battery voltage, currents, state-of-charge, cell-balance, and environmental conditions inside the battery enclosure. This controller is largely a data-telemetry gathering item, but also includes an important low-voltage disconnect features which shuts down the 24V battery bus during periods of low-battery state-of-charge. During these periods the system continues to convert wave-energy and charge the batteries, but all sources of significant battery drain are disconnected which allows the battery to re-charge to a serviceable level, even in calm conditions. Spring Controller (SC_): This micro-controller primarily monitors the piston position and a load-cell located between the buoy and power take-off component. Additionally, this controller responds to commands to change the gas pressure in each chamber of the pneumatic spring, a pump to move gas from the lower pressure chamber to the higher pressure chamber, and a valve to do the opposite. Additionally, this controller can turn power on and off to the heave-cone. Power Converter (PC_): This controller implements the field-oriented control of the winding current in the generator. It's core function is to control the winding current to a set target, but it performs a number of other specialized functions as well. In particular, the converter monitors and reports motor RPM, and by default sets the motor winding current target as a pre-defined function of RPM. This default behavior can be modified (scale and offset), or over-ridden entirely. In this later case the power converter only over-rides the default winding-current for a short period of time (2 seconds). If a new winding-current command does not arrive in that time, the system reverts to the built-in default behavior. The power converter also can switch power on and off to the batteries, divert power to an internal load-dump if the batteries are full or disconnected, and monitors the bus voltage and other health functions. The power converter also obeys current draw/charge limits specified depending on the size and capability of the attached battery pack. Heave-cone Controller (TC_): This controller is responsible for opening and closing the heave-cone doors when commanded. For storm-safety, the controller will open the doors one hour after power from the surface is lost, or a watchdog timer expires. Battery back-up of the system enables this, and the buoy system must issue a watchdog reset at least every hour to keep the doors closed. In addition, this controller has an IMU and pressure sensor that provides attitude and depth information about the heave-cone. Note: This is denoted \"TC_\", the T stands for trefoil, which is French for clover and refers to the heave-cone doors themselves. The on-board linux computer is accessible from shore over a radio link (cell-modem, satellite, or line-of-site radio). This link enables enabling data-telemetry, real-time control, and software-updates to be applied to the Linux computer. Sensors and Measurements Load Cell: This is a load cell between the buoy and the power take-off device, and has a range of up to 20,000lbs. Piston Position: Inside the pneumatic spring there is a laser range-finder that continuously monitors the position of the power take-off piston. Pneumatic Pressures: The spring controller monitors the pressures of the two gas-chambers that make up the pneumatic spring. Hydraulic Compensator Pressure The hydraulic system has a small pressurized accumulator attached to the low-pressure side of the hydraulic circuit. This applies a small pressure (3psi) to ensure seawater does not enter the hydraulic system. An abrupt drop in this pressure indicates a hydraulic leak and is therefore monitored and reported. Buoy Inertial Measurement Unit: On-board the buoy there is a GPS disciplined six DOF attitude-heading and reference system. This unit monitors and reports the buoys attitude and GPS location. Heave Cone Inertial Measurement Unit: On-board the heave-cone there is an attitude-heading and reference system with a magnetometer and pressure sensor that reports the heave-cones orientation and depth. Electrical System Sensors: Voltages and currents are monitored throughout the electrical system and reported by various controllers. In particular the motor winding currents, the load-dump current, and the battery current are all independently monitored and reported.","title":"Architecture"},{"location":"architecture/#buoy-heave-cone-and-mooring","text":"The buoy in the MBARI-WEC has a diameter of 2.6m, a water-plane area of 5 m^2, and a mass of 1400kg.

Gazebo can use several different physics solvers to perform this solution, and the wave-energy buoy simulator in this project uses the DART physics engine. The physics engine solves the multi-body six degree-of-freedom problem for the motion of the connected buoy, power-take-off device, and heave cone, subject to initial conditions and forces that act on the various components as the simulation progresses. In the Gazebo simulator, these forces are provided by plugin code that applies forces to each body based on the state (position and velocity) of each component in the system at each timestep. The Gazebo simulator already includes several plugins that provide relevant forces such as buoyancy and hydrodynamic drag. Additionally, several additional plugins have been created for this simulator that provide the forcings on the system due to the electro-hydraulic power-take-off system, the pneumatic spring system, the tether connecting the PTO to the heave-cone, the mooring system that anchors the system, and the forcing on the buoy from the ocean surface waves. The sections below outline some details about how each of these forcings are modelled and computed. First however, the specific physical characteristics of the MBARI WEC are tabulated for reference. Physical Characteristics Each rigid body in the simulation has a \"Link Frame\" coordinate system in which all other characteristics of the body are defined in for computational purposes. This link-frame coordinate system is often selected to be at the location of a joint that connects the various bodies (which are also called links in the vernacular of Gazebo).

Electro-Hydraulic PTO Forces Pneumatic Spring Forces Definitions Description Units x Piston position m v Piston velocity m/s m Mass of gas in chamber kg T Temperature of gas K P Gas pressure Pa V Chamber volume (dependent on piston position) m ^{3} R_{specific} Specific Gas Constant N _2 J/kg/K V_{dead} Chamber dead volume (fully compressed) m ^{3} c_p Specific Heat Capacity N _2 (constant pressure) J/kg/K A_{piston} Surface area of piston head m ^{2} n Polytropic index (Adiabatic if n=\\lambda=1.4 for N _2 ) N/A r Coefficient of heat transfer (Newton's Law of Cooling) 1/s Model Under compression and expansion, the pressure, volume and temperature of the Nitrogen in each chamber evolves according to Ideal Gas Law: P V = m R_{specific} T and a polytropic process: P = P_0 \\left({V_{0} \\over V}\\right)^{n} with hysteresis, there are two values for the polytropic index, n_1 and n_2 , to capture behavior when the gas is compressing or expanding. Using this quasi-static solution and discrete time steps, and also incorporating hysteresis, the process becomes: V_k = x_k A_{piston} + V_{dead} P_k = P_{k-1} \\left({V_{k-1} \\over V_k}\\right)^n ,\\,\\,\\, n = \\begin{cases} n_1 & \\text{if } v \\ge 0 \\\\ n_2 & \\text{otherwise.} \\end{cases} T_k = {P_k V_k \\over m R_{specific}} where k is the current time step. Whenever the piston velocity is slow enough, the process is dominated by heat loss and modeled with Newton's Law of Cooling (using forward difference) followed by an update of pressure using Ideal Gas Law: T_k = r\\, \\Delta t\\, (T_{env} - T_{k-1}) + T_{k-1} V_k = x_k A_{piston} + V_{dead} P_k = {m R_{specific} T_k \\over V_k} The mass of the Nitrogen in each chamber is determined from inputs in the SDF: m = {P_0 (x_0 A_{piston} + V_{dead}) \\over R_{specific} T_0} and is used for mass flow between chambers in simulating the pump/valve. Determining Parameter Values Linear regression was used to determine the polytropic indices for each chamber using empirical data from the physical system. Using pressure vs volume curves, n_1 is determined from increasing volume, and n_2 is determined from decreasing volume. The data is then preconditioned by taking the logarithm to linearize and perform regression to find the parameters. For a polytropic process: P V^{n} = C so, \\log{P} + n \\log{V} = \\log{C} \\left[ { \\begin{array}{cc} \\log{\\bf V} & 1 \\\\ \\end{array} } \\right] \\left[ { \\begin{array}{c} -n \\\\ \\log{C} \\\\ \\end{array} } \\right] = \\log{\\bf P} in block matrix notation where {\\bf V} and {\\bf P} are the arrays of volume and pressure data, respectively. The other parameters in the system are taken from CAD or empirically determined by comparing logged data from prescribed motion between simulation and the physical test bench.

Gazebo can use several different physics solvers to perform this solution, and the wave-energy buoy simulator in this project uses the DART physics engine. The physics engine solves the multi-body six degree-of-freedom problem for the motion of the connected buoy, power-take-off device, and heave cone, subject to initial conditions and forces that act on the various components as the simulation progresses. In the Gazebo simulator, these forces are provided by plugin code that applies forces to each body based on the state (position and velocity) of each component in the system at each timestep. The Gazebo simulator already includes several plugins that provide relevant forces such as buoyancy and hydrodynamic drag. Additionally, several additional plugins have been created for this simulator that provide the forcings on the system due to the electro-hydraulic power-take-off system, the pneumatic spring system, the tether connecting the PTO to the heave-cone, the mooring system that anchors the system, and the forcing on the buoy from the ocean surface waves. The sections below outline some details about how each of these forcings are modelled and computed.

Implement Controller Assuming you have followed the above, include/<your_package_name>/control_policy.hpp src/controller.cpp are stubbed out to implement your custom external controller. You may also use config/controller.yaml for any policy parameters. ControlPolicy You may use the struct ControlPolicy in control_policy.hpp to implement your controller. include/your_package_name/control_policy.hpp 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 struct ControlPolicy { // declare/init any parameter variables here double foo { 1.0 }; double bar { 10.0 * foo }; ControlPolicy () : foo { 1.0 }, bar { 10.0 * foo } { update_params (); } // Update dependent variables after reading in params void update_params () { bar = 10.0 * foo ; } // Modify function inputs as desired // Calculate target value from feedback inputs double target ( const double & /*some*/ , const double & /*feedback*/ , const double & /*values*/ ) { // secret sauce return 0.0 ; // obviously, modify to return proper target value } }; Declare/define any configurable parameters in the struct and init list include/your_package_name/control_policy.hpp 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 // declare/init any parameter variables here double foo { 1.0 }; double bar { 10.0 * foo }; ControlPolicy () : foo { 1.0 }, bar { 10.0 * foo } Set any dependent variables in update_params on line 39 include/your_package_name/control_policy.hpp 38 39 40 41 42 // Update dependent variables after reading in params void update_params () { bar = 10.0 * foo ; } Declare/get/update params in the set_params function of the Controller class on line 58 include/your_package_name/control_policy.hpp 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 // Use ROS2 declare_parameter and get_parameter to set policy params void Controller::set_params () { this -> declare_parameter ( \"foo\" , policy_ -> foo ); policy_ -> foo = this -> get_parameter ( \"foo\" ). as_double (); // recompute any dependent variables policy_ -> update_params (); } Then, your control logic will go in the target function on line 46. Modify the input args as well as the return value as necessary include/your_package_name/control_policy.hpp 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 // Modify function inputs as desired // Calculate target value from feedback inputs double target ( const double & /*some*/ , const double & /*feedback*/ , const double & /*values*/ ) { // secret sauce return 0.0 ; // obviously, modify to return proper target value } Controller The Controller class contains an instance of ControlPolicy as the member variable, this->policy . The this->policy->target function may be called anywhere within the Controller class. You may call it inside any of the data callbacks to enable feedback control (for example): (EXAMPLE) include/your_package_name/controller.hpp // To subscribe to any topic, simply declare & define the specific callback, e.g. power_callback // Callback for '/power_data' topic from Power Controller void power_callback ( const buoy_interfaces :: msg :: PCRecord & data ) { // get target value from control policy double wind_curr = policy_ -> target ( data . rpm , data . scale , data . retract ); auto future = this -> send_pc_wind_curr_command ( wind_curr ); } Or, set up a loop in main and run open-loop: (EXAMPLE) src/controller.cpp int main ( int argc , char ** argv ) { rclcpp :: init ( argc , argv ); auto controller = std :: make_shared < Controller > ( \"controller\" ); rclcpp :: Rate rate ( 50.0 ); while ( rclcpp :: ok ()) { rclcpp :: spin_once ( controller ); rate . sleep (); } rclcpp :: shutdown (); return 0 ; } You may get feedback data from any of the buoy topics by simply creating a specific callback listed below. For feedback data you'd like to use in another area of the class, feel free to assign them to class variables. (Delete any callbacks you don't need in the Controller class) Available callback functions: /ahrs_data \u2192 void ahrs_callback(const buoy_interfaces::msg::XBRecord & data){} /battery_data \u2192 void battery_callback(const buoy_interfaces::msg::BCRecord & data){} /spring_data \u2192 void spring_callback(const buoy_interfaces::msg::SCRecord & data){} /power_data \u2192 void power_callback(const buoy_interfaces::msg::PCRecord & data){} /trefoil_data \u2192 void trefoil_callback(const buoy_interfaces::msg::TFRecord & data){} /powerbuoy_data \u2192 void powerbuoy_callback(const buoy_interfaces::msg::PBRecord & data){} You may also send commands from within the Controller class: this->send_pump_command(duration_mins); this->send_valve_command(duration_sec); this->send_pc_wind_curr_command(wind_curr_amps); this->send_pc_bias_curr_command(bias_curr_amps); this->send_pc_scale_command(scale_factor); this->send_pc_retract_command(retract_factor); In the Controller constructor, you may also uncomment lines 31 or 32 to set the publish rates for the Spring or Power Controllers on the buoy. These controllers default to publishing feedback at 10Hz to conserve data/bandwidth (on the physical buoy). For feedback control, you have the option to increase the publish rate. You can call commands to set the rates anywhere from 10Hz to 50Hz (default argument is 50Hz). src/controller.cpp 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 Controller :: Controller ( const std :: string & node_name ) : buoy_api :: Interface < Controller > ( node_name ), policy_ ( std :: make_unique < ControlPolicy > ()) { this -> set_params (); // set packet rates from controllers here // controller defaults to publishing @ 10Hz // call these to set rate to 50Hz or provide argument for specific rate // this->set_sc_pack_rate_param(); // set SC publish rate to 50Hz // this->set_pc_pack_rate_param(); // set PC publish rate to 50Hz } Build, Test, Run At this point, your new package should build, pass tests, and run against the sim (will connect but do nothing). It is assumed that you have already installed or built the buoy packages. From your workspace (e.g. ~/controller_ws ) build your package: $ colcon build Starting >>> mbari_wec_template_cpp Finished <<< mbari_wec_template_cpp [25.0s] Summary: 1 package finished [25.2s] You may also build only your new controller package (if you have other packages in the workspace) using: $ colcon build --packages-up-to <your_package_name> Then, source and test: $ source install/local_setup.bash $ colcon test Starting >>> mbari_wec_template_cpp Finished <<< mbari_wec_template_cpp [1.38s] Summary: 1 package finished [1.54s] Or, you may test only your new controller package using: $ colcon test --packages-select <your_package_name> Next, in another terminal run the sim (after sourcing the sim packages of course): $ ros2 launch buoy_gazebo mbari_wec.launch.py Now, in the previous terminal, launch the empty controller: $ ros2 launch <your_package_name> controller.launch.py And you should see something similar to: [INFO] [launch]: Default logging verbosity is set to INFO [INFO] [mbari_wec_template_cpp-1]: process started with pid [1297902] [mbari_wec_template_cpp-1] [INFO] [1678127525.594948064] [mbari_wec_template_cpp]: Subscribing to XBRecord on '/ahrs_data' and '/xb_record' [mbari_wec_template_cpp-1] [INFO] [1678127525.595508167] [mbari_wec_template_cpp]: Subscribing to BCRecord on '/battery_data' and '/bc_record' [mbari_wec_template_cpp-1] [INFO] [1678127525.595795098] [mbari_wec_template_cpp]: Subscribing to SCRecord on '/spring_data' and '/sc_record' [mbari_wec_template_cpp-1] [INFO] [1678127525.596027219] [mbari_wec_template_cpp]: Subscribing to PCRecord on '/power_data' and '/pc_record' [mbari_wec_template_cpp-1] [INFO] [1678127525.596275007] [mbari_wec_template_cpp]: Subscribing to TFRecord on '/trefoil_data' and '/tf_record' [mbari_wec_template_cpp-1] [INFO] [1678127525.596593805] [mbari_wec_template_cpp]: Subscribing to PBRecord on '/powerbuoy_data' [mbari_wec_template_cpp-1] [INFO] [1678127525.697067297] [mbari_wec_template_cpp]: /pc_pack_rate_command not available [mbari_wec_template_cpp-1] [INFO] [1678127525.797309937] [mbari_wec_template_cpp]: /sc_pack_rate_command not available [mbari_wec_template_cpp-1] [INFO] [1678127525.797524439] [mbari_wec_template_cpp]: Found all required services.

(Delete any callbacks you don't need in the Controller class) Available callback functions: /ahrs_data \u2192 void ahrs_callback(const buoy_interfaces::msg::XBRecord & data){} /battery_data \u2192 void battery_callback(const buoy_interfaces::msg::BCRecord & data){} /spring_data \u2192 void spring_callback(const buoy_interfaces::msg::SCRecord & data){} /power_data \u2192 void power_callback(const buoy_interfaces::msg::PCRecord & data){} /trefoil_data \u2192 void trefoil_callback(const buoy_interfaces::msg::TFRecord & data){} /powerbuoy_data \u2192 void powerbuoy_callback(const buoy_interfaces::msg::PBRecord & data){} You may also send commands from within the Controller class: this->send_pump_command(duration_mins); this->send_valve_command(duration_sec); this->send_pc_wind_curr_command(wind_curr_amps); this->send_pc_bias_curr_command(bias_curr_amps); this->send_pc_scale_command(scale_factor); this->send_pc_retract_command(retract_factor); In the Controller constructor, you may also uncomment lines 31 or 32 to set the publish rates for the Spring or Power Controllers on the buoy. These controllers default to publishing feedback at 10Hz to conserve data/bandwidth (on the physical buoy). For feedback control, you have the option to increase the publish rate. You can call commands to set the rates anywhere from 10Hz to 50Hz (default argument is 50Hz). src/controller.cpp 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 Controller :: Controller ( const std :: string & node_name ) : buoy_api :: Interface < Controller > ( node_name ), policy_ ( std :: make_unique < ControlPolicy > ()) { this -> set_params (); // set packet rates from controllers here // controller defaults to publishing @ 10Hz // call these to set rate to 50Hz or provide argument for specific rate // this->set_sc_pack_rate_param(); // set SC publish rate to 50Hz // this->set_pc_pack_rate_param(); // set PC publish rate to 50Hz }","title":"Controller"},{"location":"Tutorials/ROS2/CPPTemplate/#build-test-run","text":"At this point, your new package should build, pass tests, and run against the sim (will connect but do nothing).

Prerequisite This tutorial assumes you are familiar the steps from the previous tutorial and have built your own custom Python ROS 2 controller package from the mbari_wec_template_py template repository which we will use to implement a simple linear damper controller.

If you haven't already, follow the steps in the above mentioned link to create a package for this tutorial named mbari_wec_linear_damper_py . Linear Damper ControlPolicy A complete example starting from the template may be found here . Line numbers in this tutorial correspond to the lines in relevant files in the full example. Parameters Parameters for the controller are: torque_constant : Motor Torque Constant (N-m/Amp) Constant to convert desired torque to applied motor winding current n_spec : Input Motor Speed (RPM) Breakpoints N (RPM) is the input to the controller and n_spec are the x-components of the breakpoints \\left(n\\_spec, \\frac{torque\\_spec}{torque_constant}\\right) for the interpolant, \\hat{f}_{I}(n\\_spec) = \\frac{torque\\_spec}{torque\\_constant} \\approx f_{I}(N) = I torque_spec : Desired Output Motor Torque (N-m) Breakpoints Torque (N-m) is the eventual desired output of the controller given an input N (motor RPM) and torque_spec / torque_constant (Amps) are the y-components of the breakpoints for the interpolant. The controller actually outputs motor winding current (Amps) to generate a torque in the opposite direction of piston velocity to generate a damping force. These can be configured using the config/controller.yaml file. config/controller.yaml 1 2 3 4 5 /linear_damper : ros__parameters : torque_constant : 0.438 n_spec : [ 0.0 , 300.0 , 600.0 , 1000.0 , 1700.0 , 4400.0 , 6790.0 ] torque_spec : [ 0.0 , 0.0 , 0.8 , 2.9 , 5.6 , 9.8 , 16.6 ] As you can see, as motor speed increases, so does the damping torque. For low RPM (up to 300), there is no damping. Initialize these variables in ControlPolicy in mbari_wec_linear_damper_py/controller.py . This example makes use of numpy.array as well as scipy.interpolate.interp1d , so don't forget to include those. mbari_wec_linear_damper_py/controller.py 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 import numpy as np from scipy import interpolate class ControlPolicy ( object ): \"\"\" Simple Linear Damper Control Policy.

I_Spec ) Control Policy Target To implement the torque control control policy, we use the target function in ControlPolicy . This is where we accept feedback data and return a command value. In this case, we need the motor rpm , and the gains applied to the winding current damping, scale_factor and retract_factor . Typical values for these gains are scale_factor = 1 retract_factor = 0.6 mbari_wec_linear_damper_py/controller.py 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 def target ( self , rpm , scale_factor , retract_factor ): \"\"\"Calculate target value from feedback inputs.\"\"\" N = abs ( rpm ) I = self . windcurr_interp1d ( N ) # Apply damping gain I *= scale_factor # Hysteresis due to gravity / wave assist if rpm > 0.0 : I *= - retract_factor return float ( I ) So, as you can see we apply a positive damping torque when N is negative (piston extending), and a positive damping torque when N is positive (piston retracting). The damping torque required is reduced when retracting. Controller All that is left is to connect the necessary feedback data to the ControlPolicy . In this case, rpm , scale , and retract are present in buoy_interfaces.msg.PCRecord on the /power_data topic published by the Power Controller running on the buoy. To access the data, all that is required is to define the callback def power_callback(self, data) in the Controller class, and pass the data to self.policy.target to get the desired winding current command. Various commands are available, and this time we will be using self.send_pc_wind_curr_command(wind_curr, blocking=False) mbari_wec_linear_damper_py/controller.py 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 def power_callback ( self , data ): \"\"\"Provide feedback of '/power_data' topic from Power Controller.\"\"\" # Update class variables, get control policy target, send commands, etc. wind_curr = self . policy . target ( data . rpm , data . scale , data . retract ) self . get_logger () . info ( 'WindingCurrent:' + f ' f( { data . rpm : .02f } , { data . scale : .02f } , { data . retract : .02f } )' + f ' = { wind_curr : .02f } ' ) self . send_pc_wind_curr_command ( wind_curr , blocking = False ) Finally, let's set the Power Controller's publish rate to the maximum of 50Hz.

ControlPolicy You may use the class ControlPolicy in <your_package_name>/controller.py to implement your controller. 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 class ControlPolicy ( object ): def __init__ ( self ): # Define any parameter variables here self . foo = 1.0 self . update_params () def update_params ( self ): \"\"\"Update dependent variables after reading in params.\"\"\" self . bar = 10.0 * self . foo pass # remove if there's anything to set above # Modify function inputs as desired def target ( self , * args , ** kwargs ): \"\"\"Calculate target value from feedback inputs.\"\"\" # secret sauce return 0.0 # obviously, modify to return proper target value Set any configurable parameters in __init__ on line 23 23 24 25 26 27 def __init__ ( self ): # Define any parameter variables here self . foo = 1.0 self . update_params () Set any dependent variables in update_params on line 29 29 30 31 32 33 def update_params ( self ): \"\"\"Update dependent variables after reading in params.\"\"\" self . bar = 10.0 * self . foo pass # remove if there's anything to set above Declare/get/update params in the set_params function of the Controller class on line 113 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 def set_params ( self ): \"\"\"Use ROS2 declare_parameter and get_parameter to set policy params.\"\"\" self . declare_parameter ( 'foo' , self . policy . foo ) self . policy . foo = \\ self . get_parameter ( 'foo' ) . get_parameter_value () . double_value # recompute any dependent variables self . policy . update_params () Then, your control logic will go in the target function on line 36.

The self.policy.target function may be called anywhere within the Controller class. You may call it inside any of the data callbacks to enable feedback control (for example): # To subscribe to any topic, simply define the specific callback, e.g. power_callback def power_callback ( self , data ): '''Callback for '/power_data' topic from Power Controller''' # get target value from control policy target_value = self . policy . target ( data . rpm , data . scale , data . retract ) # send a command, e.g. winding current self . send_pc_wind_curr_command ( target_value , blocking = False ) Or, set up a loop in main() and run open-loop: 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 def main (): rclpy . init () controller = Controller () rate = controller . create_rate ( 50.0 ) # Hz while rclpy . ok (): # Open-loop control logic rclpy . spin_once ( controller ) rate . sleep () rclpy . shutdown () You may get feedback data from any of the buoy topics by simply creating a specific callback listed below. For feedback data you'd like to use in another area of the class, feel free to assign them to class variables. (Delete any callbacks you don't need in the Controller class) Available callback functions: /ahrs_data \u2192 def ahrs_callback(self, data): /battery_data \u2192 def battery_callback(self, data): /spring_data \u2192 def spring_callback(self, data): /power_data \u2192 def power_callback(self, data): /trefoil_data \u2192 def trefoil_callback(self, data): /powerbuoy_data \u2192 def powerbuoy_callback(self, data): You may also send commands from within the Controller class: self.send_pump_command(duration_mins, blocking=False) self.send_valve_command(duration_sec, blocking=False) self.send_pc_wind_curr_command(wind_curr_amps, blocking=False) self.send_pc_bias_curr_command(bias_curr_amps, blocking=False) self.send_pc_scale_command(scale_factor, blocking=False) self.send_pc_retract_command(retract_factor, blocking=False) In the Controller constructor, you may also uncomment lines 55 or 56 to set the publish rates for the Spring or Power Controllers on the buoy. These controllers default to publishing at 10Hz. You can call commands to set the rates anywhere from 10Hz to 50Hz (default argument is 50Hz). 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 def __init__ ( self ): super () . __init__ ( 'controller' ) self . policy = ControlPolicy () self . set_params () # set packet rates from controllers here # controller defaults to publishing @ 10Hz # call these to set rate to 50Hz or provide argument for specific rate # self.set_pc_pack_rate_param() # set PC publish rate to 50Hz # self.set_sc_pack_rate_param() # set SC publish rate to 50Hz Build, Test, Run At this point, your new package should build, pass tests, and run against the sim (will connect but do nothing).

Therefore, open a new terminal window and do the following: Source the workspace $ . ~/buoy_ws/install/setup.sh Launch the simulation $ ros2 launch buoy_gazebo mbari_wec.launch.py The Gazebo rendering of the buoy system should become visible and appear as follows: To start the simulation, press the \"play\" arrow in the lower left, the buoy should start to move in response to incoming waves. It is also possible to adjust various parameters such as the sea-state, visibility of the rendering, and speed the simulation will run relative to real-time. These topics are covered in a later tutorial. To view the ROS2 messages and associated data while the simulation runs, proceed to the next tutorial: View ROS2 Messages Notes on Workspaces The step of sourcing the workspace is important and must be done in every window that the simulation and associated tools are accessed from. It is possible, and possibly convenient, to put the source command from step 1 above in the .bashrc or similar place if a different shell is being used.

So when re-compiling the source often it can be problematic to have this line in .bashrc.

This is a Linux executable that implements a number of commands, accepts appropriate arguments, and issues commands over the CANbus or ROS 2 on the buoy to effect a change of buoy behavior. These commands can also be issued programmatically as described in subsequent tutorials, but pbcmd is the human interface. This same command and interface is implemented in the simulation environment, so it is possible to change the behavior of the simulated buoy from the command line in the same way as can be done on the physical buoy. However many of the possible commands are not sensible in the simulated environment, so are not implemented, but instead return a message indicating they aren't relevant in simulation. A key example is the command to open and close the heave-cone doors, because the simulator can not change this behavior while running, the command to do so is inactive. Similarly, it makes no sense to turn on and off the electrical ground fault detector that exists on the buoy, but does not exist in simulation. pbcmd Usage Issuing 'pbcmd' at the command prompt provides guidance on the possible commands. In simulation it also indicates which commands are supported in simulation, on the at-sea system, all commands have an effect. $ ./pbcmd pbcmd: Multi-call command Power Buoy dispatcher Commands currently supported in Simulation: * pump - Spring Controller pump off or on for a time in minutes <= 10 * valve - Spring Controller valve off or on for a time in seconds <= 12 * sc_pack_rate - Set the CANBUS packet rate from the spring controller * pc_Scale - Set the scale factor * pc_Retract - Set the retract factor * pc_WindCurr - Set the winding current target * pc_BiasCurr - Set the winding current bias * pc_PackRate - Set the CANBUS packet rate Commands currently not supported in Simulation: * bender - Sets the state of the bender module * reset_battery - Reset battery controller (caution - no args) * tether - Spring Controller tether power on or off * reset_spring - Reset Spring Controller (caution - no args) * pc_VTargMax - Set the max target voltage * pc_ChargeCurrLim - Set the maximum battery charge current * pc_DrawCurrLim - Set the maximum battery current draw * pc_BattSwitch - Set the battery switch state * pc_Gain - Set the gain scheduler gain * pc_StdDevTarg - Set the target RPM standard deviation * tf_SetPos - Open/close the doors in the heave-cone * tf_SetActualPos - Open/close the doors in the heave-cone * tf_SetMode - Set controller mode * tf_SetChargeMode - Set Battery Charge mode * tf_SetStateMachine - Set Battery Charge mode * tf_SetCurrLim - Set controller current limit * tf_WatchDog - Toggle controller watchdog (caution - no args) * tf_Reset - Reset Controller (caution - no args) For help on a command use the command name, i.e. \"bender\"; Except the reset commands which take no arguments. DO NOT enter reset_battery and expect to get help. The command will execute! Note that at the end of this usage message, there is a hint that typing most commands without an argument will supply some further help. Command descriptions pump - This command turns on and off the gas pump that pumps Nitrogen from the upper pneumatic spring chamber to the lower spring chamber. The result of this is the mean position of the position will slowly rise. The rate is about 1 inch per minute of pump action, a required argument for this command specifies how long the pump will run for, in minutes, and must be between 0 and 10. After this timeout the pump will stop even if no further commands are issued. A \"pump 0\" command stops the pump immediately. valve - The valve command releases Nitrogen gas from the lower chamber to the upper chamber, resulting in the mean position of the piston lowering. This process is much faster so the required argument for this command is in seconds, and must be between 0 and 10. After this timeout the valve closes even if no further commands are issued. A \"valve 0\" command closes the pump immediately. sc_pack_rate - This command sets the data packet rate for data coming from the spring controller, the required argument between 10 and 50 indicates the desired data rate in Hz. This controls the rate of the ROS 2 messages from the spring controller on the buoy, and in the simulator. pc_scale - This command adjusts the multiplier that is applied to the default motor-current/RPM relationship that is programmed into the power converter. This value can be from 0.4 to 1.5, allowing a range of damping to be applied. pc_Retract - This command adjusts an additional multiplier that is applied to the default motor-current/RPM relationship during piston retraction. This value can be from 0.4 to 1.0, and allows the damping behavior of the system to be asymmetrical, promoting retraction since the pneumatic spring can not pull as hard as the waves can. pc_WindCurr - This command directly sets the winding current in the electric motor and accepts a value between -35 Amps and +35 Amps. This value is the quadrature current in the permanent magnet electric motor, and therefore corresponds directly with applied torque. A positive winding current produces a torque that applies a force that retracts the piston. The controller applies this specified torque for two seconds. After that time, if no new pc_WindCurr command is executed, the system returns to following the default motor-current/RPM relationship (adjusted by the Scale and Retract factor as described). This allows safety in the case of a communication failure, and makes it a bit impractical to manipulate the winding current manually from the keyboard. As described in subsequent tutorials, programmatically adjusting this value in response to the behavior of the wave-energy converter is the primary automated external control mechanism. pc_BiasCurr - This command applies an offset to the default motor-current/RPM relationship. This value can be between -15 Amps and +15 Amps and is applied for 10 seconds before the system reverts to the default motor-current/RPM relationship. A positive current corresponds to a torque that tends to retract the piston. This command is useful for temporarily changing the equilibrium point of the piston at sea. pc_pack_rate - This command sets the data packet rate for data coming from the power converter, the required argument between 10 and 50 indicates the desired data rate in Hz. This controls the rate of the ROS 2 messages from the power converter on the buoy, and in the simulator. Example Usage As an example, issue the following commands in a terminal where the workspace has been sourced: Launch the simulation without incident waves by issuing the following commands, the first command over-rides the default sea-state and results in no incident wave-forcing on the buoy when the \"regenerate_models\" flag is set to false: $ empy -D 'inc_wave_spectrum_type=\"None\"' -o ~/buoy_ws/install/buoy_description/share/buoy_description/models/mbari_wec/model.sdf ~/buoy_ws/install/buoy_description/share/buoy_description/models/mbari_wec/model.sdf.em $ ros2 launch buoy_gazebo mbari_wec.launch.py regenerate_models:=false Start the simulation in the GUI by pressing the play button. Start PlotJuggler $ ros2 run plotjuggler plotjuggler & Select messages wcurrent and rpm from the /power_data topic and the range_finder message from the /spring_data topic, and then create plots to display these messages in separate windows. Issue the following command to introduce a 10A winding current offset in the motor-current/RPM relationship. $ pc_BiasCurr 10 After 20 seconds of simulation time or so, the plotjuggler window should look approximately as below. One can see that the command resulted in an additional 10 Amps of motor winding current being present (time = 6 seconds in plot), this additional torque spins the motor and a force is applied to retract the piston, which is evident in the range_finder data. After a 10 second timeout, because no new current over-ride command is issued, the system reverts to the default motor-current/RPM relationship that doesn't include the offset (time = 16 seconds in plot). After this extra torque is removed, the weight of the heave cone causes the piston to extend back to it's nominal mean position causing the motor to spin in the opposite direction (time = 16-20 seconds in the plot). The default motor-current/RPM relationship is programmed to resist this motion and a smaller positive motor-current is applied during this time. After time = 21 seconds, the energy of the raised heave-cone has been dissipated into the PTO system and the system comes mostly to rest. The slow creep of the piston beyond 21 seconds is due to the heating effects of the pneumatic spring, heat has been created in the gas spring which slowly dissipates to the environment and the lower spring pressure drops slowly and lowers the piston gradually. Exercises To extend the previous example, some interesting exercises to try are the following: Repeat the above example but also plot the battery voltage and current. Observe how current flows from the battery to raise the piston and heave cone when the pc_BiasCurr 10 command is issued, and then when the timeout occurs, the potential energy of the raised heave cone is converted to electrical energy and current flows into the battery, with a commensurate change in battery voltage. Plot the upper and lower spring pressures, observer how they change relative to piston position, and their decay in time after the piston comes to rest. Repeatedly issue the \"pc_BiasCurr 10\" command before the timeout expires, note how the timeout is extended to 10 seconds beyond the last command issued. Issue a \"pc_WindCurr 10\" command instead of the pc_BiasCurr command. This command directly sets the winding current, so the resulting winding current is not affected by the motor RPM until after the timeout has expired. For this command, the timeout is two seconds. Plot other messages while manipulating the winding current. Note how the buoy and heave-cone positions as well as the load cell value respond to the dynamics of the floating bodies.","title":"SimulatorInteractionPbcmd"},{"location":"Tutorials/Simulation/SimulatorInteractionPbcmd/#run-time-control-using-pbcmd","text":"","title":"Run-Time Control using pbcmd"},{"location":"Tutorials/Simulation/SimulatorInteractionPbcmd/#introduction","text":"There is a command interpreter running on the physical buoy that provides some control over the behavior of the buoy while it is deployed.

In most cases, one may want to run the simulator with different values for these parameters, and/or run a number of simulations that iterate across a range of values for particular parameters. For instance, one may want to run the simulator in a batch mode that runs the same buoy and controller set-up in a range of sea-states. To facilitate this, a batch tool is provided that allows one to specify ranges for a number of parameters, and then run a number of simulations for all combinations of parameters, saving the results separately. This tutorial describes these capabilities, demonstrates with some examples, and discusses how this tool can be used. Parameters There are a number of parameters that impact the behavior of the simulator, and must be specified at start-up: Simulation duration : How long the simulation will run for (simulation time) in seconds. Time-step size : The simulation proceeds at a fixed time-step size, and this can be specified for each run. Heave cone door-state : Simulations can be done with the heave-cone doors either opened or closed, the door position can not be changed during a simulation, so this is a parameter that must be specified at start-up. Sea-State : Incoming waves can be specified as a monochromatic wave with a specified amplitude and period, a Bretschneider spectrum of waves described by significant wave-height and the peak period, or by a custom wave-spectrum defined by a curve of wave-energy versus frequency. Wave phase random seed : The phases of each wave-component are randomly assigned, if a seed is specified, the phases will be the same for each run of a simulation. This is useful for comparing simulations for which one wants the same wave-excitation. If the seed value is set to zero, or omitted, a different random phase assignment will be made for each simulation run. Physics Real-Time Factor (RTF) : This parameter sets the maximum speed the simulation will be allowed to run, in terms of a multiple of real-time. i.e. a Real-Time factor of 2.0 will limit the simulation to only running twice as fast as real-time. As described below, for single runs for which one may want to monitor the motion as it occurs, a Real-Time Factor of 1.0 is appropriate. For batches of runs one wants to complete as fast as possible, a large RTF (i.e. 100) will let the simulation run as fast as the processing resources allow. Battery State-of-Charge : The starting battery state of charge can be specified between 0 (empty) and 1 (full). A full battery can't absorb energy so more of the generated power will be diverted to the load-dump in the simulation. An empty battery will allow most or all of the generated energy to flow to the battery. This does not effect the physical behavior of the simulated buoy, but does effect the battery voltages and currents as the simulation progresses. Battery EMF : As an alternative to specifying the battery state of charge as a percentage, the zero-load battery voltage can be specified, between 270V (empty battery), and 320V (full battery). Scale Factor : The buoy (and simulator) implements a default control algorithm in which the current in the motor windings is set as a function of motor RPM, with the resulting torque opposing the motors motion. This approximately implements a linear damping behavior and the specified Scale Factor is multiplied by the default Winding-Current/RPM relationship before being applied. Allowable values are from 0.5 to 1.4, and the result is a simple way to change the damping the power-takeoff device is applying to the system. As discussed in a later tutorial, this relationship can be over-ridden with external code, so this Scale Factor only applies to the default behavior of the system. GUI Output : The graphical output of the simulator can be turned on or off as needed, for large batches of runs that are meant to run un-attended this is probably not appropriate, but for single runs or debugging the graphical output can be useful. Example Batch File The above parameters are specified in a .yaml file that the batch-run tool reads in before execution begins. A commented example is below and illustrates the use of the above parameters. Lines that begin with # are comments and have no impact. # # Batch-Specific Scalar Parameters # duration: 300 seed: 42 physics_rtf: 11 # # Run-Specific Parameters (Test Matrix) # physics_step: [0.001, 0.01, 0.1] door_state: ['closed', 'open'] scale_factor: [0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.3, 1.4] enable_gui: False # May specify vector/scalar battery_soc (0.0 to 1.0) or battery_emf (270V to 320V) battery_soc: [0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0] # battery_emf: [282.5, 295.0, 307.5, 320.0] IncidentWaveSpectrumType: - MonoChromatic: # A & T may be vector/scalar in pairs (A & T same length) A: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0] T: [12.0, 14.0, 15.0] - Bretschneider: # Hs & Tp may be vector/scalar in pairs (Hs & Tp same length) Hs: 3.0 Tp: 14.0 # Multiple Custom Spectra must be listed individually (w & Szz are already vectors of same size) - Custom: w: [0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 2.0] Szz: [0.0, 0.4, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0] As seen in this example, some parameters are enforced to be scalar values and apply to the entire batch of specified runs. These are the specification of simulation duration (300), random seed (42), and the physics real-time factor (11). The remaining run-specific parameters can be specified as arrays, and the batch-run tool then executes simulations for all possible combinations of these values. Note that some values are specified in pairs. For instance, three mono-chromatic waves are specified by this file with a specification of (A=1.0m, T=12s), (A=2.0m, T=14s), and (A=3.0m, T=15s), not nine runs that include all possible combinations of the specified amplitude and periods. Obviously it would be very easy to write a batch file specification that includes thousands of runs, more practical usage will most likely iterate over a small number of parameters at at a time. Running an example For a simpler example, a batch file that iterates across a range of sea-states is used. As a concise example, the following file illustrates this, comments have been removed for brevity. duration: 3 seed: 42 physics_rtf: 11 enable_gui: False physics_step: 0.01 door_state: ['closed'] scale_factor: [0.6, 1.0] battery_soc: 0.5 IncidentWaveSpectrumType: - Bretschneider: Hs: [2.0, 4.0] Tp: [14.0, 16.0] To run this example, create the above file in a new directory and name it \"IrregularWaves.yaml\", source the simulator installation directory, and start the simulation using the batch tool. (Note that the run duration is very short for this example to allow it to complete quickly) $ mkdir FOO $ cd FOO $ Create file using editor of your choice, name it IrregularWaves.yaml $ . ~/buoy_ws/install/setup.bash $ ros2 launch buoy_gazebo mbari_wec_batch.launch.py sim_params_yaml:=IrregularWaves.yaml Running these commands will run the simulation, all output is stored in a directory named similar to `batch_results_20230228210735', the trailing numbers indicate a timestamp. Inside this directory the yaml file is repeated, along with a log file 'batch_results.log' that lists all of the simulation runs that were performed. Alongside that are specific directories that hold output from each run. For convenience, a symbolic link is formed that points at the most recent batch output directory. Within the output directory, there is a file named 'batch_runs.log' that shows each individual run that was performed, and the associated parameter. In this case it has the following contents: # Generated 4 simulation runs RunIndex, SimReturnCode, StartTime, rosbag2FileName, PhysicsStep, PhysicsRTF, Seed, Duration, DoorState, ScaleFactor, BatteryState, IncWaveSpectrumType;In cWaveSpectrumParams 0, 0, 20230228212457, rosbag2_batch_sim_0_20230228212457, 0.01, 11.0, 42, 3.0, closed, 0.6, 0.5, Bretschneider;Hs:2.0;Tp:14.0 1, 0, 20230228212502, rosbag2_batch_sim_1_20230228212502, 0.01, 11.0, 42, 3.0, closed, 0.6, 0.5, Bretschneider;Hs:4.0;Tp:16.0 2, 0, 20230228212506, rosbag2_batch_sim_2_20230228212506, 0.01, 11.0, 42, 3.0, closed, 1.0, 0.5, Bretschneider;Hs:2.0;Tp:14.0 3, 0, 20230228212510, rosbag2_batch_sim_3_20230228212510, 0.01, 11.0, 42, 3.0, closed, 1.0, 0.5, Bretschneider;Hs:4.0;Tp:16.0 For simulations that take longer to run, it can be convenient to tail this log file from the terminal to keep track of progress. i.e. From the directory the batch was started from: $ tail -f latest_batch_results/batch_runs.log Finding the output Within the batch process output directory, (e.g. `batch_results_20230228210735'), the output of each simulation run is stored within a single sub-directory.

In general the information in these two files are the same, the .csv files are in clear text and are easy to inspect, and can be processed by the same tools used for the actual buoy data. The rosbag files are binary files that encode all of the ROS2 messages on the computer during the simulation. These files can be processed by a number of tools for post-processing and inspection of results. It is also possible to load the rosbag files into plotjuggler for plotting and inspection, as described in the View Messages with Plotjuggler Tutorial.","title":"SimulatorParameters"},{"location":"Tutorials/Simulation/SimulatorParameters/#parameters-and-batch-runs","text":"","title":"Parameters and Batch Runs"},{"location":"Tutorials/Simulation/SimulatorParameters/#introduction","text":"When running a simple instance of the simulator as described in the Run the Simulator Tutorial. i.e. using: $ ros2 launch buoy_gazebo mbari_wec.launch.py the simulation uses a number of defaults for a range of parameters.
